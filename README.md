# Music Player (Android)
Play musics under third-party app folder in background

## Version
1.0.0

## Preface
There are many music player for free, however none for them (that I've tried) can play music storing in third party folder (e.g. under Dropbox folder).
The build-in player on Samsung Android can play regular music file in background, but it cannot play music files in third party folder in background (It will not scan those folder).

## Scope
Personal usage to solve the problem in [Preface](#preface).

## Goal
Play any supported audio format musics in background without keeping screen on.

## Todo
Save "delete" option on songs without slowing down the launching speed.
