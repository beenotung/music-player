# Music Player (Android)
Play music under third-party app folder in background

## Version
1.0.0

## Preface
There are many music players for free. However, none of them (that I've tried) can play music storing in third party folder (e.g. under Dropbox folder).
The built-in player on Samsung Android can play regular music files in the background, but it cannot play music files in third party folder in the background (It will not scan those folders, nor user can explicitly add a folder).

## Scope
Personal usage to solve the problem in [Preface](#preface).

## Goal
Play any supported audio format music in the background without keeping the screen on.

## Todo
Save "delete" option on songs without slowing down the launching speed.
